Tutorial4 sample [Nested Set Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model) solution:

Another way of representing trees is to show them as nested sets. i.e. Uses `containment` represents `subordination`. The drawing below shows the organisation chart tree structure represented as nested sets:

We can then model the org units chart with number pairs `left` and `right` value as shown below:
